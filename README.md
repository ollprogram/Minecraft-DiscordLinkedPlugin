# Dependencies for developpers :
You can directly use this <a href="https://github.com/ollprogram/Minecraft-DiscordLinkedPlugin/blob/main/pom.xml">pom.xml</a> if you want to use Maven.
You will probably want to change some fields. I'm using two different APIs:
<ul>
  <li> JDA (<a href = "https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA">Java Discord API</a>)</li>
  <li> Spigot (<a href = "https://www.spigotmc.org">An API for Minecraft servers</a>)</li>
</ul>
